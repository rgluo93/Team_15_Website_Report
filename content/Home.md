## **Abstract**

### **Problem Statement**

Less than 50% of Grade 4 children in Kenya are learning at the expected level (Usawa Agenda, 2023).One of the root causes is teaching quality. Teachers often lack access to adequate professional development opportunities. Our project is aimed at developing software, LeadNow, to help coach educators in Kenya. Our project incorporates AI features into the software to improve the experience and impact of LeadNow.
